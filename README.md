# AisleWise

A mobile app design aimed at improving the grocery shopping experience by optimizing in-store navigation and list management.

## Problem

As a Hy-Vee Aisles Online Shopper, I've seen firsthand how customers waste time navigating inefficiently through the store or struggle to find specific items. This results in longer shopping trips and frustration, especially in larger grocery stores.

## Solution

AisleWise is a mobile app that helps everyday shoppers build smarter grocery lists. It auto sorts those lists based on item categories and the store's layout, providing a step-by-step in-store path so shoppers can move through the aisles in an optimized, logical order.
